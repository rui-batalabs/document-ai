## Introduction

The AI-Powered Document Analysis Platform allows users to upload documents, process their content using AI, and interact with the information through a large language model (LLM). Users can receive document summaries, ask specific questions, and get contextual answers, making document analysis faster and more efficient. The platform is especially useful for handling business reports, legal contracts, research papers, and other document-heavy industries.

## Motivation

Document analysis can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with long and complex texts. The platform provides an easy way for users to interact with documents, enabling them to extract key information and insights without reading the entire content. Users can upload documents, receive AI-generated summaries, and ask targeted questions to better understand important points. This makes the platform ideal for legal teams, business analysts, researchers, and more.
